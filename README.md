# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis was to practice using neural networks and deep learning models. During the process, we learned how to:
- Compare the differences between traditional machine learning classification, regression models and the neural network models.
- Describe the perceptron model and its components.
- Implement neural network models using TensorFlow.
- Explain how different neural network structures change algorithm performance.
- Preprocess and construct datasets for neural network models.
- Compare the differences between neural network models and deep neural networks.
- Implement deep neural network models using TensorFlow.
- Save trained TensorFlow models for later use.
## Results: 
Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers

- Data Preprocessing
  - "IS_SUCCESSFUL", which indicates if a charity used their donations effeectively, was the target for the model.
  - "APPLICATION_TYPE" and "CLASSIFICATION" were the features for the model.
  - "EIN" and "NAME", which were identificatoins models, were not targets nor features. Therefore, they were removed from the input data.
- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
  - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  - What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary: 
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
